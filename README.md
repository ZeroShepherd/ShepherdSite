# ShepherdSite
My personal site, being built with Java. Please feel free to contribute code. The project is built in Java using Maven,
really the idea behind this is for me to learn and build something that I can use and continue to work on. I welcome any code
improvements or any suggestions on how to make things better, litterally I am working through tutorials and documentation to 
figure all this out so please, any pointers are welcomed. It's not going to be perfect but I'll figure it out as I go.
